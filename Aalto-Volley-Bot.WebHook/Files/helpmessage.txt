Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Aalto-Volley-Bot, and I aim to provide you with helpful info and tools about all things Aalto-Volley. Write '/' in the chat to get a list of my commands. Below are brief explanations of some services I provide.

<b>Nimenhuuto tools</b>
<i>Description TBD...</i>

<b>Hietsu Beach Volley tools</b>
<i>Description TBD...</i>

For any questions or comments, you may contact @Saulikaiseri. If you want to become a contributor, you can find a link to the source code below.

<b>Notes:</b>
-<i>The current deployment in Google Cloud is left idle upon POST requests, meaning the bot won't awaken automatically on new messages. You can awaken the bot manually by clicking the link below.</i>
-<i>Currently in group chats, you have to add '@aaltovolley_bot' at the end of your command, e.g. '/help@aaltovolley_bot'. Looking to automate this in the future.</i>
